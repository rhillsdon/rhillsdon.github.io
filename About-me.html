										<!-- <h2>Nulla luctus eleifend purus</h2> -->
										<p><a href="#" class="image image-left"><img src="images/selfportrait1.png" alt="Myself, Circa January 2016."></a>I've never been good at describing myself. Despite countless school projects where I've been required to do just that, I've always struggled with starting it off. Maybe it's because, on the surface, I really don't stand out that much. A middle-class, caucasian male highschooler doesn't turn many heads these days. Not that it needs to; really, I feel as though talent, interest, and opinion are better qualifiers of a person, and we really shouldn't be categorizing people like that anyways.</p>
										<p>For a long time, I considered myself an intellectual, and to a point, I still do. However, more recently I consider myself somewhat of a patron of the arts. Since I was a kid, I was a huge bookworm. I loved learning, reading, and, strangely enough, video games. I still love books, but I've moved up from Archie Comics and Bone to online articles and e-readers. I've also developed an appreciation for cinema, and I still love science more than ever. What really stuck with me though, was games. Games have become my passion, hobby, and life. I love all kinds of games; stupid entertaining games, highly competetive games, and most of all, games that have something to say. I'm a firm believer that all games are art, though some are "more art" than others. My first ever video game was Super Mario 64, a universally acclaimed and beloved game that redefined 3D gaming. What a way to set the bar high right off the bat. From there, I dabbled in Nintendo on and off, but the point in time where I became truly enamored with gaming when, much to my parents mistake, I got my first ever real PC game, Mass Effect 2, at the age of twelve. After years of playing nothing but nintendo games and terrible bargain bin garbage, I was completely blown away by the game. It was technically impressive, visually stunning, and extremely fun. It also did something no other game had done before: it made me think. Not just about my tactics, or the extremely engrossing game world, but also about, well, pretty much everything else. It had a lot of social commentary, a lot of points to make about the human condition. It had something to say, and it did a damn good job doing it. It was then I realized the power of games as a creative medium.</p>
										<p>Games like Mass Effect 2, Deus Ex, and the countless great indie games have inspired me. I firmly believe that my true calling lies in game development. Every kid wants to be a game developer when their a kid, but actually understanding and putting into practice how games are made: programming, art assets, concept art, music, sound design, animation, level design, mechanical design, general game design, direction, etc. is a whole different ball game. Luckily, I happen to quite like that particualr ball game, and for years I've studied game design and development in my spare time. From retro classics, to modern masterpieces, I believe every game has at least some value in some way. There are bad games, but even those were made by someone. I firmly believe that games are the next big artistic medium, quickly reaching the levels of film and books as a piece of entertainment, education, and art. With that in mind, I'd like to get a formal education in game design or something similar, and go on to create games as a carreer. However, I'm also interested in technology as a whole: hardware, software, web design, etc. and I wouldn't mind a role in one of those industries either.</p>
                                        <p>On this website, you will find a collection of my past and current works, as well as some upcoming projects. I hope that you find what your looking for here, and if you don't feel free to drop me a line at  <a href="mailto:richard.hillsdon@rogers.com">richard.hillsdon@rogers.com</a>.</p>
